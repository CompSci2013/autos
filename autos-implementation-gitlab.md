### Creating Issues in GitLab

**Via Web UI:**

1. Navigate to http://gitlab.minilab/halo/autos/-/issues
2. Click **New issue**
3. Copy/paste issue template from above
4. Select appropriate labels
5. Assign to milestone
6. Set weight (optional)
7. Assign to yourself
8. Click **Create issue**

**Best Practices:**

- Create all Phase 1 issues before starting work
- Reference issue numbers in commits: `Related: #3`
- Close issues with: `Closes #3` in commit message or MR description
- Update issue descriptions if requirements change
- Add comments to issues as work progresses

---

### Branch Creation from Issues

**Pattern:**
```bash
# For Issue #3
git checkout -b feature/3-create-index-script

# For Issue #11
git checkout -b feature/11-vehicle-picker

# For bugfix on Issue #15
git checkout -b bugfix/15-manufacturer-filter
```

**Commit Pattern:**
```bash
git commit -m "feat(etl): Create Elasticsearch index script

- Implement create_autos_index.py
- Define vehicle mappings
- Add error handling

Related: #3"
```

**Push and Create MR:**
```bash
git push gitlab feature/3-create-index-script
# Then create MR in GitLab UI with "Closes #3"
```

---

### Tracking Progress

**GitLab Board View:**
- Navigate to http://gitlab.minilab/halo/autos/-/boards
- Drag issues between columns:
  - **Open** â†’ **To Do** â†’ **In Progress** â†’ **Review** â†’ **Done**
- Filter by milestone to see phase progress
- Filter by label to see component-specific work

**Milestone View:**
- Navigate to http://gitlab.minilab/halo/autos/-/milestones
- See percentage complete
- View open vs closed issues
- Track blockers

---

### Issue Dependencies

**Visualizing Dependencies:**

```
Phase 1 Dependency Chain:
#1 (Research) â†’ #2 (Container) â†’ #3 (Index Script) â†’ #4 (Load Data) â†’ #5 (Verify)

Phase 2 depends on Phase 1:
#5 (Verify) â†’ #6 (Backend API)

Phase 3 depends on Phase 2:
#6 (Backend API) â†’ #11 (Frontend Picker)
```

**Managing Blocked Issues:**
- Add `blocked` label
- Reference blocking issue: "Blocked by: #3"
- Don't start work until blocker resolved
- Update status when unblocked

---

### Daily Workflow with GitLab

**Morning Routine:**
```bash
# 1. Pull latest changes
cd /home/odin/projects/autos
git pull

# 2. Check GitLab board for assigned issues
# Visit: http://gitlab.minilab/halo/autos/-/boards

# 3. Pick next issue from "To Do" column

# 4. Move issue to "In Progress"

# 5. Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/3-create-index-script
```

**During Development:**
```bash
# Make changes
# ...

# Commit frequently with issue reference
git commit -m "feat(etl): Add index mapping definitions

Related: #3"

# Push to share progress
git push gitlab feature/3-create-index-script
```

**End of Work Session:**
```bash
# Push all commits
git push gitlab feature/3-create-index-script

# Add progress comment to issue in GitLab:
# "Index mappings defined. Next: implement creation logic."

# If complete, create MR with "Closes #3"
```

### Documentation Updates

**When implementation differs from spec:**

1. Update relevant documentation files
2. Include doc updates in same MR as code
3. Reference in MR description:
   ```markdown
   ## Documentation Updates
   - Updated docs/autos-data-sources-model.md with actual schema
   - Added notes about NHTSA API rate limits
   ```

**Commit pattern:**
```bash
git add docs/autos-data-sources-model.md
git commit -m "docs(etl): Update schema based on implementation

- Reflect actual field names used
- Add notes on NHTSA API quirks
- Update example queries

Related: #3"
