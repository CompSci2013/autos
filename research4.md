Toggle with Goggles.
Let's keep the page enjoyable to use without pestering the user for input. The site should be very intuitive and require no log in for general use. A person who registers for an account will have the ability to save their preferences and may 'see' the site as it was on their last navigation.
Perhaps the side of the page while have a list of 'Goggles' that can be clicked that changes the view/orientation of the site. By fun or enjoyable, I do NOT mean silly. If people roll their eyes, they are not likely to be repeat visitors.

Maybe clicking the 'Beer Goggles' quickly narrow's down to a list of typically 'ugly' autos that only the true enthusiast Motor Head would find beautiful? 

Further areas for research:
* Google types? Does this idea even make sense?
* Terminology, lexicon, phrases: what are common 'technical jargon' terms bandied about by practitioners? What terms are considered complementary? pejorative? expected common knowledge?
