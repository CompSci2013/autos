## **🏗️ ARCHITECTURE APPROACH**

### **Single Database, Multiple Views:**

```
Core Data Layer (The Diamond)
        ↓
  Presentation Layer (The Facets)
        ↓
    ┌────┴────┬────────┬──────────┬───────────┐
    ↓         ↓        ↓          ↓           ↓
 General  Motor   Jr Motor  Investor  Historian
Consumer  Head     Head    Collector  etc...
```

### **Implementation Strategy:**

**Option A: Role-Based Views**
- User selects persona on first visit
- Site adapts content/UI accordingly
- Can switch personas anytime

**Option B: Smart Homepage**
- Present quick quiz: "What brings you here today?"
- Route to appropriate experience
- Breadcrumbs allow exploring other facets

**Option C: Unified Interface with Toggles**
- All content available always
- Toggle switches like:
  - "Show technical specs" (Motor Head mode)
  - "Show investment data" (Collector mode)
  - "Simplified view" (General Consumer mode)

## **💡 IMPLEMENTATION RECOMMENDATION**

**Phase 1 (MVP):** 
- Build for **Motor Head** persona (your core audience)
- Include basic **"About X"** pages with available data
- Keep architecture flexible for future persona additions

**Phase 2:**
- Add **Jr. Motor Head** experience (educational focus)
- Enhance "About X" pages with designer bios
- Add timeline visualizations

**Phase 3:**
- Expand to **General Consumer** and **Investor** views
- Community features (forums, photo galleries)
- Advanced search/filtering per persona

---

**Does this multi-persona approach align with your vision? Should we prioritize which personas to build for first, or design the full architecture now and implement incrementally?** 🎯
