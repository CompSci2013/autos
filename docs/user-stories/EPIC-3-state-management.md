# Epic 3: State Management & URL Sharing

**Epic ID:** EPIC-3
**Epic Owner:** Technical Lead
**Status:** Complete
**Priority:** Critical
**Business Value:** Enable users to bookmark, share, and navigate searches seamlessly

---

## Epic Description

Implement URL-first state management architecture where all query state lives in URL parameters. This enables bookmarking, sharing, and browser back/forward navigation while maintaining clean separation between query state (URL) and UI preferences (localStorage).

**Success Metrics:**
- 100% of query state persists in URL
- Users can share URLs that reproduce exact search results
- Browser back/forward works correctly
- No lost state on page refresh

---

## Feature 3.1: URL-Driven State Architecture

### Story 3.1.1: Route State Service

**As a** developer,
**I want** a service that manages URL query parameters,
**So that** I can read/write state to the URL consistently across components.

**Priority:** Critical
**Story Points:** 8
**Sprint:** Sprint 1 (Foundation)

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Service: `RouteStateService`
- [ ] Methods:
  - `getCurrentParams()`: Get snapshot of all params
  - `getParam(key)`: Get single param value
  - `watchParam(key)`: Observable of param changes
  - `updateParams(params)`: Merge with existing params
  - `setParams(params)`: Replace all params
  - `removeParam(key)`: Remove single param
  - `clearAllParams()`: Remove all params
- [ ] Utilities:
  - `filtersToParams(filters)`: Convert SearchFilters to URL params
  - `paramsToFilters(params)`: Parse URL params to SearchFilters
- [ ] Singleton service (providedIn: 'root')

#### Technical Notes
- Uses Angular `ActivatedRoute` and `Router`
- Uses `queryParamsHandling: 'merge'` for updates
- Type-safe conversions (SearchFilters â†” URL params)

#### Definition of Done
- [ ] Unit tests: 90%+ coverage
- [ ] Documentation with examples
- [ ] Handles array parameters (models)
- [ ] Handles nested objects (flatten/unflatten)

### Story 3.1.2: State Management Service

**As a** developer,
**I want** a central service that orchestrates state updates and API calls,
**So that** all components use consistent state management patterns.

**Priority:** Critical
**Story Points:** 13
**Sprint:** Sprint 1-2 (Foundation)

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Service: `StateManagementService`
- [ ] Observables:

  - `results$`: Vehicle search results
  - `loading$`: Loading state
  - `error$`: Error messages
  - `totalResults$`: Total result count
- [ ] Methods:
  - `updateFilters(filters)`: Update filters + sync to URL + fetch data
  - `updatePage(page)`: Change page number
  - `updateSort(column, direction)`: Change sort
  - `resetFilters()`: Clear all filters
  - `fetchVehicleData()`: Execute API request
- [ ] Integration with `RouteStateService`
- [ ] Integration with `RequestCoordinatorService`

#### Technical Notes
- BehaviorSubject for state streams
- Immutable state updates
- Automatic URL synchronization
- Triggers API calls after state changes

#### Definition of Done
