## Sprint Planning Guidelines

### Story Selection Criteria
- Stories should be independent (minimal dependencies)
- Stories should be negotiable (details can be discussed)
- Stories should be valuable (deliver user value)
- Stories should be estimable (team can estimate effort)
- Stories should be small (fit within sprint)
- Stories should be testable (clear acceptance criteria)

### Velocity Tracking
- Track completed story points per sprint
- Use historical velocity for sprint planning
- Adjust estimates based on actual completion time
