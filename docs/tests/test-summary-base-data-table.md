---

### ❌ Failing Tests (2/17)

#### Test 1: Multiple Active Filters
**Test:** `should handle multiple active filters`  
**Location:** Line 180  
**Status:** 🔴 FAILING  
**Expected:** 2 fetch calls (one per filter)  
**Actual:** 1 fetch call  

**Failure Details:**
```
Expected 1 to be 2
```

**Root Cause:** After first filter triggers fetch, subsequent filter changes are blocked by `areQueryParamsEqual()` check in `ngOnChanges`.

---

#### Test 2: Repeated Internal Filter Changes
**Test:** `should NOT skip fetch when user types in filter repeatedly (internal changes)`  
**Location:** Line 288-293  
**Status:** 🔴 FAILING  
**Expected:** 3 fetch calls (Ford → Toyota → Honda)  
**Actual:** 1 fetch call  

**Failure Details:**
```
Expected 1 to be 2  (second filter change)
Expected 1 to be 3  (third filter change)
```

**Console Log Evidence:**
```
LOG: '⏭️ QueryParams unchanged, skipping fetch'
```

**Root Cause:** The `areQueryParamsEqual()` function in `ngOnChanges` is blocking internal filter changes from triggering fetches after the initial change.

---

## Root Cause Analysis

### The Problem

The `areQueryParamsEqual()` function was added to solve a **performance issue**:
- **Before:** Selecting manufacturers in picker caused progressive slowdown
- **After:** Performance fixed, but filters broke

### Why Filters Break

**The Flow:**

1. ✅ User types "Ford" → `onFilterChange()` called
2. ✅ Debounce (400ms) → `filterSubject$` fires
3. ✅ `fetchData()` called → updates table
4. ✅ `queryParamsChange.emit()` → parent notified
5. ❌ **Next filter change ("Toyota"):**
   - `onFilterChange()` called → updates `this.filters`
   - Debounce (400ms) → `filterSubject$` fires
   - Somehow triggers `ngOnChanges` 
   - `areQueryParamsEqual()` returns `true` (params haven't changed from parent's perspective)
   - **Fetch is skipped** ⏭️
6. ❌ Table doesn't update, filter appears "broken"

### The Core Issue

The `areQueryParamsEqual()` check is designed to prevent unnecessary fetches when the **parent** sends back unchanged params (good for performance), but it's **also blocking internal filter changes** initiated by the user typing (bad for functionality).

**Two Types of Changes:**
- **External Changes:** Parent updates `@Input() queryParams` → should check equality
- **Internal Changes:** User types in filter → should ALWAYS fetch

Currently, both go through the same `ngOnChanges` check, causing internal changes to be blocked.

## Technical Details

### Component State

**File:** `base-data-table.component.ts`

**Key Methods:**
```typescript
// User types → called directly
onFilterChange(columnKey: string, value: any): void {
  if (value === null || value === undefined || value === '') {
    delete this.filters[columnKey];
  } else {
    this.filters[columnKey] = value;
  }
  this.filterSubject$.next(); // Triggers debounce
}

// After 400ms debounce
filterSubject$.subscribe(() => {
  this.currentPage = 1;
  this.fetchData(); // ✅ This works the first time
});

// Fetches data and emits to parent
fetchData(): void {
  // ... fetch logic ...
  this.queryParamsChange.emit(params); // Notifies parent
}

// Parent updates queryParams input → triggers this
ngOnChanges(changes: SimpleChanges): void {
  if (changes['queryParams'] && !changes['queryParams'].firstChange) {
    const prev = changes['queryParams'].previousValue;
    const curr = changes['queryParams'].currentValue;
    
    if (!this.areQueryParamsEqual(prev, curr)) {
      this.fetchData(); // ✅ Good for external changes
    } else {
      console.log('⏭️ QueryParams unchanged, skipping fetch');
      // ❌ Bad - blocks subsequent internal filter changes!
    }
  }
}
```

## Proposed Solutions

### Option 1: Track Change Source (Recommended)
Add a flag to distinguish internal vs external changes:

```typescript
private isInternalChange = false;

onFilterChange(columnKey: string, value: any): void {
  this.isInternalChange = true; // Mark as internal
  // ... existing logic ...
  this.filterSubject$.next();
}

ngOnChanges(changes: SimpleChanges): void {
  if (this.isInternalChange) {
    this.isInternalChange = false;
    return; // Don't block internal changes
  }
  
  // Only check equality for external changes
  if (changes['queryParams'] && !changes['queryParams'].firstChange) {
    // ... existing equality check ...
  }
}
```

### Option 2: Remove Equality Check from Filter Flow
Only apply `areQueryParamsEqual()` to specific types of external changes (pagination, sorting) but not filters:

```typescript
ngOnChanges(changes: SimpleChanges): void {
  if (changes['queryParams'] && !changes['queryParams'].firstChange) {
    const prev = changes['queryParams'].previousValue;
    const curr = changes['queryParams'].currentValue;
    
    // Only check equality if filters haven't changed
    const filtersChanged = JSON.stringify(prev.filters) !== JSON.stringify(curr.filters);
    
    if (filtersChanged || !this.areQueryParamsEqual(prev, curr)) {
      this.fetchData();
    }
  }
}
```

### Option 3: Separate Filter State Management
Make filters completely internal and don't emit them via `queryParamsChange`:

```typescript
// Filters are purely internal - don't go through parent
filterSubject$.subscribe(() => {
  this.fetchDataWithInternalFilters(); // Always fetch, no equality check
});
```

## Lessons Learned

### Testing Insights

1. **Test Infrastructure Matters** - Spent significant time on Chromium setup, icon configuration, and mock creation. This foundation makes future tests much easier.

2. **Mock Data Should Match Reality** - Initially used 'make' field, actual data uses 'manufacturer'. Always verify mock data matches production models.

3. **Spy Timing is Critical** - Must set up spies BEFORE `fixture.detectChanges()` if testing ngOnInit behavior.

4. **Change Detection in OnPush** - Must call `fixture.detectChanges()` after async operations to update view.

5. **Tests Can Find Real Bugs** - The new "repeated filter changes" test immediately exposed the production bug.

### Development Insights

1. **Performance vs Functionality Trade-offs** - The `areQueryParamsEqual()` optimization fixed performance but broke filters. Always test after optimization.

2. **Internal vs External State** - Components with both @Input and internal state need clear separation of concerns.

3. **Debouncing Complexity** - Debounced operations interacting with lifecycle hooks can create subtle bugs.

4. **Test-Driven Bug Fixing** - Writing tests that expose bugs before fixing them ensures the fix actually works.
