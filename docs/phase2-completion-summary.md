## ðŸŽ‰ **Phase 2: Backend API Development - COMPLETE**

### Summary of Accomplishments

**âœ… Backend Application Built**
- Node.js + Express REST API created with proper MVC architecture
- Elasticsearch client integration with connection testing
- Manufacturer-model aggregation queries implemented
- Search functionality with fuzzy matching
- Pagination support (configurable page size, up to 100 results)
- CORS middleware for frontend integration
- Comprehensive error handling

**âœ… API Endpoints Deployed**
- `GET /health` - Health check for Kubernetes probes
- `GET /api/v1/manufacturer-model-combinations` - Main data endpoint
  - Query parameters: `page`, `size`, `search`, `manufacturer`
  - Returns aggregated manufacturer-model data from Elasticsearch

**âœ… Containerization Completed**
- Development Dockerfile created
- Production container image built: `localhost/autos-backend:v1.0.0`
- Image exported and imported to K3s successfully
- Container size: 180.9 MiB

**âœ… Kubernetes Deployment Successful**
- `autos` namespace created for application isolation
- Backend deployment with 2 replicas running on Thor
- ClusterIP service exposing port 3000 internally
- Health and readiness probes configured
- Resource limits set (256Mi memory, 500m CPU)
- Node selector configured to use Thor exclusively

**âœ… GitLab Workflow Followed**
- Issue #2 created, completed, and closed
- Feature branch `feature/2-backend-api` used
- Proper commit messages with issue references
- Merge request created and merged
- 423 lines of code added across 11 files

### Current System Status

**Infrastructure:**
```
Elasticsearch (data namespace)
  â””â”€ autos-unified index: 60 vehicles, 6 manufacturers

Kubernetes (autos namespace)
  â”œâ”€ autos-backend deployment: 2/2 replicas running
  â””â”€ autos-backend service: ClusterIP at 10.43.187.98:3000
```

**Internal Service URL:**
```
http://autos-backend.autos.svc.cluster.local:3000
```

**Tested and Verified:**
- âœ… Elasticsearch connection from pods
- âœ… Health endpoint responding
- âœ… API returning correct manufacturer-model data
- âœ… Search functionality working (fuzzy match on manufacturer/model)
- âœ… Pagination working (tested with page=1, size=3)

### What's Next: Phase 3 Preview

**Frontend Application (Angular 14)**
- Vehicle picker table component (manufacturer-model checkboxes)
- Integration with backend API
- Goggles sidebar (view-switching system)
- Results display based on selections
- Deployment to Kubernetes with Ingress

**Estimated Duration:** 4-5 days

**Phase 2 Status:** âœ… **COMPLETE**  
**Issue #2:** âœ… **CLOSED**  
**Ready for:** Phase 3 - Frontend Development

Excellent work! The backend API is fully functional, deployed to Kubernetes, and ready to serve the frontend application. All code is committed and documented according to the GitLab workflow.
